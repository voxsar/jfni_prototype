# 3D Model Generator Issue - Implementation Complete

## Summary

This pull request successfully implements all requirements from the issue "3d model generator issue". The implementation adds advanced features for creating foldable 3D models from PDF dielines, including polygon-based drawing, unit conversion, validation, and merged geometry generation.

## Issue Requirements ‚úÖ

All requirements from the original issue have been addressed:

### ‚úÖ 1. Generate a Single 3D Plane (Not Multiple)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- GeometryCompiler now merges all cutlines into a single boundary
- ThreeScene generates single ExtrudeGeometry from merged shape
- Inner cutlines become holes in the main geometry
- Result: One cohesive, foldable 3D plane

### ‚úÖ 2. Continuous Line (Polygon Tool)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Cut lines use click-to-place polygon mode
- Similar to Photoshop's polygon tool
- Visual markers show each point (yellow for first, green for others)
- Preview line shows shape as you draw
- Close by clicking near first point or pressing Enter
- Cancel with Escape key

### ‚úÖ 3. Unit Switch (Inches/CM)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Toggle button switches between inches and centimeters
- Button shows current unit: "üìè Inches" or "üìè CM"
- Conversion: 96 DPI for inches, 37.8 for cm
- Used in expand cutline and other measurement features

### ‚úÖ 4. Crease Tool Validation
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Validates crease lines connect to cut lines at both ends
- Visual warning icons (‚ö†Ô∏è) for invalid creases
- Validation button shows detailed report
- 10-pixel tolerance for connection detection
- Automatic validation when adding creases

### ‚úÖ 5. Cut-off Highlight Button
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Toggle button "‚úÇÔ∏è Cutoff" highlights areas not in 3D plane
- Faint red overlay: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)
- Shows areas that will be removed
- Can be toggled on/off

### ‚úÖ 6. Cut Lines Always Completed
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Polygon mode ensures all cut lines are closed
- Minimum 3 points required
- Automatically connects last point to first
- Cannot create incomplete cut lines

### ‚úÖ 7. Merged Cutlines
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Multiple cutlines merge using boolean union concept
- Outer boundary is primary shape
- Inner cutlines become holes
- Example: Box cutline + circle cutline = box with circular hole

### ‚úÖ 8. Expand Cutline Tool
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Context menu option: "Expand Cutline..."
- Enter measurement value in current units
- Polygon offset algorithm expands shape uniformly
- Preserves shape while increasing size
