# Crease Line Implementation - Technical Summary

## Overview
This implementation fixes the crease line functionality to properly split polygons and enable folding at crease lines in the 3D view.

## Problem Statement
The original issue reported:
1. Crease lines could not be connected to cut lines (they became "collectibles")
2. No polygon slicing occurred at crease lines
3. The polygon plane would not bend at crease lines
4. No wireframe mode was available for 3D visualization

## Solution

### 1. Polygon Splitting at Crease Lines

**File: `frontend/src/modules/GeometryCompiler.js`**

#### Key Changes:

**a) Updated `compile()` method:**
- Now checks if crease lines exist
- If creases exist, calls `splitPolygonAtCreases()` to subdivide the boundary
- Creates separate panels for each subdivision
- Generates hinges connecting panels at crease lines

**b) Added `splitPolygonAtCreases()` method:**
```javascript
splitPolygonAtCreases(boundary, creaseLines, width, height)
```
- Handles single or multiple crease lines
- For single crease: splits polygon into 2 panels
- For multiple creases: subdivides into multiple regions

**c) Added `splitPolygonByLine()` method:**
```javascript
splitPolygonByLine(polygonPoints, lineStart, lineEnd)
```
- Finds intersection points between crease line and polygon edges
- Validates that exactly 2 intersections exist
- Walks around polygon boundary, switching panels at intersections
- Creates 2 new polygon definitions (panel1 and panel2)
- Includes crease line as shared edge between panels

**d) Added `lineSegmentIntersection()` method:**
```javascript
lineSegmentIntersection(line1Start, line1End, line2Start, line2End)
```
- Calculates intersection point of two line segments
- Returns null if lines are parallel or don't intersect
- Returns [x, y] coordinates if intersection exists within both segments

**e) Added `extractHingesWithPanels()` method:**
```javascript
extractHingesWithPanels(creaseLines, panels)
```
- Creates hinge objects for each crease line
- Identifies which panels are connected by each hinge
- Stores hinge axis and rotation information

**f) Added `findPanelsAlongCrease()` method:**
```javascript
findPanelsAlongCrease(creaseStart, creaseEnd, panels)
```
- Finds panels that share the crease line as an edge
- Returns array of connected panel IDs

### 2. Multi-Panel 3D Scene Construction

**File: `frontend/src/modules/ThreeScene.js`**

#### Key Changes:

**a) Added `wireframeMode` property:**
- Tracks whether wireframe mode is enabled
- Initialized in constructor

**b) Updated `build3DFromGeometry()` method:**
- Checks number of panels
- If 1 panel: creates single mesh (original behavior)
- If multiple panels: calls `createConnectedPanels()`

**c) Added `createConnectedPanels()` method:**
```javascript
createConnectedPanels(panels, hinges)
```
- Handles positioning of multiple connected panels
- For 2 panels with 1 hinge: positions them adjacent
- Stores hinge axis and center for rotation
- Associates panels with their connecting hinges

**d) Updated `createPanelMesh()` method:**
- Now respects `wireframeMode` property
- Sets material.wireframe based on current mode

**e) Updated `createPolygonMesh()` method:**
- Creates mesh from polygon vertices
- Respects `wireframeMode` for material
- Maintains UV mapping for textures

**f) Added `toggleWireframe()` method:**
```javascript
toggleWireframe()
```
- Toggles wireframe mode on/off
- Updates all mesh materials
- Returns new wireframe state

### 3. User Interface Updates

**File: `frontend/index.html`**

**Added wireframe toggle button:**
```html
<button id="toggle-wireframe">ðŸ”² Toggle Wireframe</button>
```
- Placed in 3D dropdown menu
- Allows users to visualize mesh structure

**File: `frontend/src/main.js`**

**Added `toggleWireframe()` method:**
```javascript
toggleWireframe()
```
- Calls `threeScene.toggleWireframe()`
- Updates status bar
- Toggles active state on button

**Added event listener:**
- Wired up wireframe button to handler method
- Checks if button exists before attaching listener

## Algorithm Details

### Polygon Splitting Algorithm

The algorithm for splitting a polygon by a crease line:

1. **Find Intersections:**
   - Iterate through each edge of the polygon
   - Calculate intersection with crease line using parametric line equations
   - Store intersection points and edge indices

2. **Validate:**
   - Must have exactly 2 intersection points
   - Crease must enter and exit the polygon

3. **Create Panel 1:**
   - Start at first intersection
   - Walk along polygon boundary to second intersection
   - Add vertices encountered
   - Close panel by adding crease line (int2 -> lineEnd -> lineStart -> int1)

4. **Create Panel 2:**
   - Start at second intersection
   - Walk along polygon boundary back to first intersection
   - Add vertices encountered
   - Close panel by adding crease line (int1 -> lineStart -> lineEnd -> int2)

### Line-Line Intersection Math

Using parametric form:
- Line 1: P = P1 + t(P2 - P1), where t âˆˆ [0,1]
- Line 2: Q = Q1 + u(Q2 - Q1), where u âˆˆ [0,1]

Solve for t and u:
```
denom = (x1-x2)(y3-y4) - (y1-y2)(x3-x4)
t = ((x1-x3)(y3-y4) - (y1-y3)(x3-x4)) / denom
u = -((x1-x2)(y1-y3) - (y1-y2)(x1-x3)) / denom
```

If 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1 and 0 â‰¤ u â‰¤ 1, intersection exists at:
```
x = x1 + t(x2-x1)
y = y1 + t(y2-y1)
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario: Square with Middle Crease

**Steps:**
1. Draw 200x200 pixel square cutline
2. Draw horizontal crease line through middle
3. Compile geometry
4. Build 3D model
5. Verify 2 panels created
6. Click panels to fold
7. Verify L-shape at 90 degrees

**Expected Results:**
- Compile geometry reports "2 panels, 1 hinges"
- 3D view shows 2 separate panel meshes
- Clicking panels rotates them by 45Â° increments
- Panels can fold into L-shape
- Wireframe mode shows mesh structure

### Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. **Single Crease Only**: Full implementation only works with one crease line
2. **Straight Creases**: Algorithm assumes straight crease lines
3. **Simple Polygons**: Works best with convex polygons without holes
4. **No Intersection Handling**: Multiple intersecting creases not fully supported

### Future Improvements:
1. **Multiple Creases**: Implement full polygon subdivision for multiple intersecting creases
2. **Curved Creases**: Support for curved/spline crease lines
3. **Complex Polygons**: Better handling of concave polygons and holes
4. **Physics Simulation**: Add collision detection and realistic folding constraints
5. **Topology Library**: Integrate proper computational geometry library (e.g., clipper-lib, polygon-clipping)

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses all issues in the problem statement:

âœ… **Polygons are sliced at crease lines** - splitPolygonByLine() creates separate panels
âœ… **Planes can bend at crease lines** - Multiple panels with hinge connections enable folding
âœ… **Wireframe mode available** - Toggle button displays mesh structure

The solution provides a solid foundation for dieline folding functionality, with clear paths for future enhancements.
