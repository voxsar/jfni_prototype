# PDF Testing Report

## Date: October 27, 2025

## Overview
This report documents the testing of the Dieline Folding Application using two PDF files located in the root directory:
1. `dielinebox.pdf` - A simple dieline with curved lines
2. `complex_dieline.pdf` - A more complex dieline with multiple features

## Test Environment
- Frontend: Vite dev server on port 3002
- Backend: PHP built-in server on port 3003 (SQLite)
- Browser: Chromium (via Playwright)
- OpenCV.js: Loaded and functional
- PDF.js: Configured with local worker

## Test Results

### 1. Initial Application Load
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED

The application loaded successfully with all features available:
- PDF loading functionality ready
- Auto-detect lines button enabled
- Annotation tools (Cut Line, Crease, Perforation, Emboss) available
- 3D view panel ready
- OpenCV.js loaded successfully

#### 2.2 Auto-Detect Lines Feature
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED

- OpenCV.js line detection executed successfully
- Detected 125 lines using color-based classification
- Lines rendered as blue annotations on the PDF
- Both straight and curved lines detected
- Validation warnings generated (expected for auto-detected lines)

**Result:** `Detected 125 lines (color-based classification)`

#### 3.2 Auto-Detect Lines Feature
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED

- OpenCV.js line detection executed successfully
- Detected 251 lines using color-based classification
- Significantly more lines detected compared to simple dieline (expected)
- Lines rendered as blue annotations
- Validation warnings generated (expected for auto-detected lines)

**Result:** `Detected 251 lines (color-based classification)`

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### Issue 1: PDF.js Worker Loading
**Problem:** Initial PDF loading failed due to PDF.js worker trying to load from CDN (cloudflare), which was blocked.

**Resolution:** 
- Copied `pdf.worker.js` from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/` to `frontend/public/`
- Updated `PDFRenderer.js` to use local worker: `pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.js';`
- **File Changed:** `frontend/src/modules/PDFRenderer.js`

### Issue 2: Backend CORS
**Problem:** Backend API health check and PDF upload endpoints were not accessible due to CORS errors.

**Impact:** Minimal - Frontend PDF loading works independently. Backend integration is not critical for PDF rendering and line detection features.

**Note:** Backend was running but CORS configuration prevented frontend from accessing it. This doesn't affect the core PDF testing functionality.

## Features Tested

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **PDF Loading** - Both simple and complex PDFs load correctly
2. **PDF Rendering** - PDF.js renders documents accurately in the 2D editor
3. **Auto-Detect Lines** - OpenCV.js successfully detects lines in both PDFs
4. **Line Classification** - Color-based line classification working
5. **Annotation Overlay** - Detected lines display as blue annotations
6. **UI Responsiveness** - All buttons and controls functional
7. **Status Messages** - Clear status updates in the footer
8. **OpenCV.js Integration** - Computer vision library loads and processes images

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Warnings
- Crease validation warnings are expected for auto-detected lines
- These occur because detected lines don't perfectly connect to cut lines
- This is normal behavior for automatic line detection and doesn't indicate a failure

### üîß Features Not Tested
- 3D model compilation (requires manual annotation of hinges)
- 3D visualization
- Fold animation
- GLB export
- Backend persistence
- Project saving/loading

---

## Performance Observations

### dielinebox.pdf
- Lines detected: 125
- Detection time: < 2 seconds
- Rendering: Smooth and responsive

### complex_dieline.pdf
- Lines detected: 251 (2x more complex)
- Detection time: < 3 seconds
- Rendering: Smooth and responsive

---

## Conclusions

### Overall Assessment: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL

Both PDF files were successfully tested with the Dieline Folding Application:

1. **PDF Loading**: Both PDFs loaded and rendered correctly
2. **Auto-Detection**: OpenCV.js successfully detected lines in both simple and complex dielines
3. **System Functionality**: Core features working as expected
4. **Scalability**: System handles both simple (125 lines) and complex (251 lines) dielines effectively

### Key Findings

1. The system successfully processes real-world dieline PDFs
2. Auto-detection scales appropriately with complexity (2x more lines in complex PDF)
3. The UI provides clear feedback on operations
4. PDF.js and OpenCV.js integration works smoothly

### Recommendations

1. Consider pre-bundling the PDF.js worker for production deployments
2. Address CORS configuration for backend integration
3. Add manual annotation features to complement auto-detection
4. Implement tests for 3D compilation and visualization features

1. **frontend/src/modules/PDFRenderer.js**
   - Changed PDF.js worker source from CDN to local file
   - Line 4: `pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.js';`

2. **frontend/public/pdf.worker.js**
   - Added PDF.js worker file to public directory for Vite to serve

### Test Artifacts
