# Crease Polygon Splitting Fix - Summary

## Problem
The crease line polygon splitting feature was not working because the code was using the crease line's endpoints (`lineStart` and `lineEnd`) to close the split polygons, instead of using only the intersection points where the crease crosses the polygon boundary.

## Root Cause
In `frontend/src/modules/GeometryCompiler.js`, the `splitPolygonByLine()` method had the following problematic code:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (BUGGY):
// After walking around polygon to second intersection...
currentPanel.push(...int2.point);
currentPanel.push(...lineEnd);      // ❌ WRONG - extends beyond polygon
currentPanel.push(...lineStart);    // ❌ WRONG - extends beyond polygon

// And for second panel...
currentPanel.push(...int1.point);
currentPanel.push(...lineStart);    // ❌ WRONG - extends beyond polygon
currentPanel.push(...lineEnd);      // ❌ WRONG - extends beyond polygon
```

This approach only worked if the crease line endpoints happened to exactly match the intersection points. When users drew crease lines that extended beyond the polygon boundaries (the normal case), the resulting polygons would have vertices outside the original boundary, creating malformed geometry.

## Solution
Remove the lines that add `lineStart` and `lineEnd`. The polygons are automatically closed because we're building them by walking around the boundary and the intersection points already form a closed loop:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED):
// After walking around polygon to second intersection...
currentPanel.push(...int2.point);
// Polygon is now closed - int1 connects back to int2 via the shared edge

// And for second panel...
currentPanel.push(...int1.point);
// Polygon is now closed - int2 connects back to int1 via the shared edge
```

## Changes Made
- **File**: `frontend/src/modules/GeometryCompiler.js`
- **Lines removed**: 4 lines (286-287, 302-303)
- **Lines added**: 4 comment lines explaining the fix

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
Created standalone test demonstrating the fix works for:
1. ✅ Crease exactly at polygon edges (baseline case)
2. ✅ Extended crease beyond boundaries (bug case - now fixed)

### Integration Tests
Tested with actual `GeometryCompiler` module:
1. ✅ Square with horizontal crease → 2 panels, 1 hinge
2. ✅ Extended crease (50px beyond boundaries) → 2 valid panels
3. ✅ Vertical crease → 2 panels, 1 hinge

All tests confirm:
- Exactly 2 panels are created
- Each panel has exactly 4 vertices
- All vertices are within valid bounds
- Panels share the crease line as a common edge
- Hinges are correctly identified between panels

## Impact
This fix enables the crease line feature to work as intended:
- Users can draw crease lines through cut polygons
- The polygon is correctly split into separate panels
- Each panel can be independently manipulated in 3D view
- Folding animations work along the crease lines

## Visual Verification
See test screenshots in PR description showing:
- Split polygons rendered correctly (green and yellow panels)
- Intersection points marked (magenta dots)
- Both panels form valid closed shapes
